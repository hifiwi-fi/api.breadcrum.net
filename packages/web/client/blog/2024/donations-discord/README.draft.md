Breadcrum now has two new community resources: Discord and Donations.
These new resources offer a modern and convenient way to connect and discuss ideas and issues related to the project.

## Discord

With some regret, Breadcrum now offers a Discord server. As a longtime fan of community-owned communication and organizing infrastructure, Breadcrum initially had an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) room. However, after years of mostly inactivity, Breadcrum has transitioned to Discord.

- ðŸ’¬ [Join the Breadcrum Discord]({{ vars.discordUrl }})

If you rely on the service and are interested in discussing ideas, design, or other development topics, feel free to join the Discord.
At the time of writing, itâ€™s literally just me in the server, so please adjust your expectations as the room grows.

## Donations

Breadcrum will eventually offer paid subscriptions with additional features and services.
These paid accounts will ensure the long-term economic viability of the service. However, as paid accounts are not yet available, some users have expressed a desire to financially support the project in the meantime.

We now have a donations page:

- ðŸ’¸ [Donate to Breadcrum](/docs/donate)

Youâ€™ll find details on ways to support the project on that page!
