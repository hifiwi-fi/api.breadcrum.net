Breadcrum.net started off way back in 2021 with a few simple sketches for a bookmarking schema and some loose ideas around archiving articles, audio and video from around the web.
The core concept was personal content archiving and media consumption tools wrapped around an "old-school" web 2.0 bookmarking service (like [del.icio.us](https://del.icio.us) or [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in)). You can still read the [original design document](https://github.com/hifiwi-fi/breadcrum.net/wiki/Design-Document).

In other words: "Submit a URL, have it do something useful with that page, and save it to you account." For now, "something useful" means content archive articles, and send media to your phone in the form of a podcast.

I'm pleased to re-review this design document and conclude, I think the MVP has been achieved!
