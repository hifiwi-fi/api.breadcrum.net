# üñ®Ô∏è Improved Printing

This is just a small update to note that printing now has an improve print style.

## The details

Here are a few things that happens to the page styles when you print documents:

- The light gray color accents are darkened up a bit.
The lighter grays look nice on screens, but they often print badly when run through PDFs and printers.
- Your username is hidden. This makes prints psudo-anonymous.
Note that the UUID of whatever you is still shown, however your account is the only one that can access it.
- The search bar is hidden. Can't search on a printed page, so why print it?

## Other random fixes

The search bar in macOS Safari now has a close button that has a visible color in dark mode.

It's open source and can be used on any HTML page that need a quick styling.

Until next time!
